							<p>
								My name is Olivia Burkett. I am a junior at Kentucky State University and a criminal justice major. 
								The idea of Good Trouble came from the positive influences that I have developed in my life, those that 
								have and continue to pave the way for me. I believe that every student/child,  deserves the same guidance 
								and encouragement.  Good Trouble is going to begin that foundation. We are here to realize the potential of 
								the youth, and to help them to exceed that potential. Good Trouble will be the positive impact on the youth 
								in our community. We are here to teach, inspire and influence.

						<div id="aboutme"> 
							<p> 
								Hello my name is Sierra Johnson. I am a student at Western Kentucky University
								working on a degree in Public Health Education. What I want to contribute to Good Trouble
								is becoming a mentor. I want to direct these kids in the right way.

							<p> 
								My Name is Damien Campbell. I just recently graduated from Eastern Kentucky 
								University with a bachelor's degree in Psychology and double minors in African/African-American
								Studies and American Sign Language (GO Class of '15!!!). I was a football student-athlete throughout 
								my four years attending EKU. I love elevating those surrounding me, whether it be mentally, spiritually, 
								or emotionally; that is why I chose the profession of psychology and why I give back. In the future, I seek 
								to first obtain a masters degree in clinical psychology and hopefully open up my own practice some day as 
								Dr. Campbell. Wish me luck!
